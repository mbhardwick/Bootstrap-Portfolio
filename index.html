        <p>I was born and raised in Seattle and currently live in the Ravenna neighborhood with my partner and our cat Schnookie. After high school, I spent several years as part of the fourth-generation operating my family's Seattle-based hardware store--Hardwick's. My Great-Grandpa Charlie started the business in 1932 by selling the furniture from his real estate office that closed due to the Great Depression. It's been located in the U-District for over 85 years!</p>

            <p>Every day at Hardwick's was different from the last. I gained experience in a variety of different areas involved with running a small retail business, while also learning trade skills and developing an interest in woodworking.</p>       
           
            <p>It was a tough decision to leave but my time there helped me develop the courage to move out of my comfort zone and I have since graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in History and a minor in Comparative Religion.</p>
